Code from Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2018) WP -- Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest: a Note on Transitory Shocks

The code can be run as a script to generate the estimates used in the latest public version of the paper (available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017059r1pap.pdf as of July, 2018), but the majority of the work was conducted using a scheduler on a cluster and that functionality has been preserved in this code, though we don't include the auxilliary files necessary to use our local cluster.  

The code was run using MATLAB 2017, but most earlier versions should work as well.  Cloning the project and running the estimateModel script/function should yield the estimates found in the latest public version of the paper.
